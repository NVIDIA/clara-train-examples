    "* Diagnostic Imaging\n",
    "  * Obtained to elicit a differential diagnosis or confirm a clinical suspicion\n",
    "* Procedural Imaging\n",
    "  * Obtained before, during, and after surgical and percutaneous invasive procedures\n",
    "* Evidence Imaging\n",
    "  * Captured primarily for documentation of a patient’s current state\n",
    "* Image-Based Clinical Reports\n",
    "  * i.e., image-enriched textual reports where thumbnail image depictions of lesions identified\n",
    "\n",
    "### Radiology AND Enterprise Imaging\n",
    "Defined as “a set of strategies, initiatives and workflows implemented across a healthcare enterprise to consistently and optimally capture, index, manage, store, distribute, view, exchange, and analyze all clinical imaging and multimedia content to enhance the electronic health record.”\n",

    "“While written descriptions of lesions and infectious  processes may be detailed,  the visual presentation of  these conditions is much more accurate and effective for diagnosis and treatment.”\n",

    "\n",
    "### ACCESS TO IMAGES IS SERIOUS BUSINESS: If I Can’t Find It, It Does Not Exist\n",
    "If imaging studies are not readily available, patients may need to be re-imaged\n",
    "* Increased patient risk (radiation, hospital-borne infections)\n",
    "* Increased cost to the patient / healthcare system (unnecessary exams)\n",
    "* Increased patient and caregiver discomfort and anxiety\n",
    "* Increased delay for the patient (while re-imaging takes place)\n",
    "* Increased delay for other patients (while re-imaging takes place)\n",
    "* Or need for increased unnecessary capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Imaging Dept Workflow\n",
    "1. Patient admitted to clinic\n",
    "2. Doctor creates order\n",
    "3. Order gets reviewed\n",

    "5. Report is written\n",
    "6. Results are distributed\n",

    "### Basic imaging workflow\n",
    "1. Modality acquires images and transmits them to archive\n",
    "2. Stores the images to a PACS (Picture Archive and Communication System)\n",

    "* DICOM® and DICOMweb™\n",
    "  * Used for imaging-centric activities\n",
    "    * E.g., PACS, post-processing - to retrieve, process, and parse the DICOM instances\n",
    "  * Retrieval of imaging\n",
    "  * Raw files with metadata as well as various renderings\n",
    "  * Both a transport and a structure specification, and integration (Application Hosting)\n",
    "* HL7® and FHIR®\n",
    "  * Used for information-centric activities\n",
    "    * E.g., EMRs, EHRs - to discover clinical data and work with order- and report-centric metadata\n",
    "  * Retrieval of all patient record data (e.g., demographics)\n",
    "  * Discrete results data (labs) and non-discrete (reports)\n",
    "  * Both a transport and a structure specification, and integration (SMART on FHIR)\n",
