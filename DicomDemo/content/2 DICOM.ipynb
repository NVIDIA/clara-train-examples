    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is DICOM?\n",
    "* **D**igital **I**maging and **CO**mmunications in **M**edicine\n",
    "* International standard (ISO 12052) for medical imaging and related information\n",
    "* First standard in 1985, current standard formed in 1993\n",
    "* One of the most widely deployed healthcare messaging standards in the world\n",
    "  * 100,000s of modalities producing images, decades in production\n",
    "  * ~ 2 trillion images annually (50% in the US)\n",
    "  * ~ 450 Petabytes per year; doubles every 5 years\n",
