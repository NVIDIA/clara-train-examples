# Clara Train Examples
### Overview of Clara Train

Clara Train SDK is a domain optimized developer application framework that includes APIs for AI-Assisted Annotation, making any medical viewer AI capable and v4.1 enables a MONAI based training framework with pre-trained models to start AI development with techniques such as Transfer Learning, Federated Learning, and AutoML.

Clara Train has upgraded its underlying infrastructure from Tensorflow to MONAI. [MONAI](https://monai.io/) is an open-source, PyTorch-based framework that provides domain-optimized foundational capabilities for healthcare.

This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks to help you explore the features and capabilities of Clara Train, including AI-Assisted Annotation, AutoML, and Federated Learning.

## How to navigate this repository
#### PyTorch - Clara Train 4.1
If you're using Clara Train 4.1, you'll want to use the PyTorch folder structure.  You'll find the README.md and Welcome.ipynb files in the [PyTorch/Notebooks](PyTorch/NoteBooks) directory that will help you get started.

#### Tensorflow-Deprecated - Clara Train 3.1
If you're still using Clara Train 3.1, we encourage you to upgrade to [Clara Train 4.1](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:clara-train-sdk). You can find information on converting your current Clara 3.1 MMAR's to [Clara 4.0 compatible MMAR's on our docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/clara-train-sdk/pt/appendix/migration_from_tf.html#migratefromtf).

If you're still interested in exploring Clara Train 3.1 using our old Jupyter Notebooks, you'll now find them under the Tensorflow-Deprecated folder.  You'll find all of the instructs in the README.me file.
